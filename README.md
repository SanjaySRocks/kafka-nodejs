**What is kafka?**

Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that facilitates the creation of real-time event data pipelines and streaming applications using a publish subscribe model. It operates as a distributed system across a cluster of servers, known as Kafka brokers, which manage the process of writing new events to partitions and handle read requests on existing partitions.
